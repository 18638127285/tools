     * introspection, before any code generation activities occur. Attributes
     * are listed as static Strings with the prefix ATTR_ in IntrospectedTable.
     * <p>
     * A good example of overriding an attribute would be the case where a user
     * wanted to change the name of one of the generated classes, change the
     * target package, or change the name of the generated SQL map file.
     * <p>
     * <b>Warning:</b> Anything that is listed as an attribute should not be
     * changed by one of the other plugin methods. For example, if you want to
     * change the name of a generated example class, you should not simply
     * change the Type in the <code>modelExampleClassGenerated()</code> method.
     * If you do, the change will not be reflected in other generated artifacts.
